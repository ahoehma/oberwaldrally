#summary Setup for hacking

= Introduction =

How to setup the IDE ...


= Details =

 * Download/Install Eclipse PDE ([http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/])
 * Download/Install m2Eclipse ([http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org/])
 * Checkout the source
 * Hack :)

= Maven =

I used maven for the project managment. At the moment pde and maven doesn't work (out of the box) together ... but maybe later ;). 

For now the maven build contains a plugin which generate some java classes for xsd definition (xml is used for board load/save). So it's necessary setup the project correctly.

You have to install the m2eclipse Plugin. The plugin will do the rest for you ;)
